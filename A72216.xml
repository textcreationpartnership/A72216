            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Comming therefore to à place called Sufide, and remaining for ſome time in the church of S. Peter by the charitable inuite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many vertuous people who liued there for deuotion; So it chanced that his nurſe borroed of a neighbour a ſieue to cleanſe wheate, which being left careleſly vpon the table was found
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173414:7"/> broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in two peeces. Wherefore at her retourne finding it broke, she began to weepe bitterly becauſe it was onely lent her.

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſently retourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his nurſe he reſtored to her the ſieue whole to her exceeding comfort.

As he was trauelling to this place, à certaine Monke called Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus mett him, and asked whither he was going, hauing vnderſtood his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, he both kept it ſecrett, and affoarded him his beſt helpe, moreouer he gaue him a Religious habitt and aſſiſted him in all things. The man of God being come to this place, liued for the ſpace of three yeares in an obſcure caue vnknowne to any man except Romanus the Monke, who liued not

But there being no way to the caue from Romanus his cell by reaſon of a ſteepe and hige rock which hung ouer it, Romanus vſed to lett downe the loafe by a long corde to which alſo he faſtened a litle bell, that by the ſound of it the man of God might know when Romanus brought him the bread. But the old enimie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying the charity of the one, and the refection of the other, when on à cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine day he beheld the bread lett downe in this manner, threw a ſtone and brake it.

About the ſame time certaine shepheards found him hid in à caue, who at the firſt eſpieing him amongſt the bushes cloathed in the skinnes of beaſts, tooke him for ſome wilde beaſt; but afterwards knowing him to be à man of God, many of them were conuerted from their ſaudage life to vertue.

                     <p>THe Holy man being on à certaine day alone, the temptour was at hand, &amp; in the likeneſſ of à litle black bird commonly called an owzell began to flie about his face, and that ſo neare, and ſo often as he might haue taken her with his hand; But no ſooner had he bleſſed himſelfe with the ſigne of the croſſe, but it vanished. When pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſo great à carnall tentation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed him, that in his life he neuer had felt the like. For the remembrance of à woman which ſometime he had ſeene was ſo liuely repreſented to his fancy by the wicked ſpiritt, and ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently did her image inflame his breaſt with luſtfull deſires, that almoſt ouercome with pleaſure, he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to leaue the wildernes. But ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly aſſiſted with diuine grace, he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173414:10"/> came to himſelfe, and ſeing neare him à thicket full of nettles and bryars, he threw of his garments, and caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe naked in to the middeſt of them, there wallowing and rooling himſelfe in thoſe sharpe thornes and nettels; ſo that when he roſe vp, his body was all pittifully rent and torne. Thus by the wounds of his flesh, he cured thoſe of his ſoule by tourning pleaſure in to paine, and by the vehemence of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward torments, he extinguished the vnlawfull flame which burnt within him, ouer coming ſinne by changing the fire. After which time as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe related to his diſciples, he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free from the like temptation, that he neuer felt any ſuch motion. Many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this beganne to forſake the world, and put themſelues vnder his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for being now altogether free from vice, he worthily deſerued to be made a Maiſter of vertue. As in Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus God commanded by Moyſes, that the Leuites should from fiue and twenty yeares and vpward, and after
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173414:10"/> fifty yeares they should be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to keepe the holy vehels.</p>

                     <p>HAuing thus vanquished this tentation, the man of God like à good ſoile well manured and weeded, brought forth aboundant fruite of the ſeede of vertue. So that the fame of his ſanctity beganne to ſpread it ſelfe more largely. Not far of was à Monaſtery whoſe Abbot being dead the whole Conuent repaired to the venerable man Benedict, and with earneſt perſwaſions requeſted him for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173414:11"/> their Abbot, which he refuſed for à longe time, forewarning them that his manner of life and theirs were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable; yet at length ouer come with importunity he gaue his conſent. But when in the ſame Monaſtery he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to obſerue Regular diſcipline, ſo that none of the Monkes (as in former time) were permitted by their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſwerue any way from the path of vertue, they repented themſelues of their choiſe in receiuing him for their Superiour, whoſe integrity of life was diſproportionable to their peruerſenes. And therefore when they perceiued themſelues reſtrained from vnlawfull acts, it greiued them to leaue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and hard it was to relinquish old cuſtomes, and beginne a new life: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the conuerſation of good men is alwayes odious to the wicked, they begane therefore to plot his death, &amp; after conſultation had together, they poiſened his wine. So when the glaſe which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained the empoiſened drinke was according to the cuſtome of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173414:12"/> Monaſtery preſented at table to be bleſſed by the Abbot, Benedict putting forth his hande and maknig the ſigne of the croſſ, the glaſſe which was held far of preſently brake in peeces, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By this the man of God perceaued eaſely that the glaſſ had in it the drinke of death which could not indure the ſigne of life. So preſently riſing vp with a mild and cheerefull countenance, hauing called the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren together, he thus ſpake vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And many things are conſidered by the perfect which ought not to be paſſed in ſilence; for they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing their endeauors to be without effect, depart to ſome other place there to employ the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues more profitablely. Wherefore that famous Preacher who deſireth to be diſſolued and be with Chriſt, vnto whom to liue is Chriſt and to dye is gayne, did not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire himſelfe to ſuffer, but did alſo ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and encourage others to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the like.

                     <p>MOreouer the Brother of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian the Monke, whom wee mentioned in the beginning, was very deuout although but à Saecular, he vſed euery yeare once to goe from his dwelling to the Monaſtery, &amp; that faſting, that he might partake of the prayers of the ſeruant of God, and ſee his Brother. As he was in his way an other trauayler who caryed meate with him put himſelfe in to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and after they had trauayled à good while he ſaid to him. Come Brother let vs refresh ourſelues, leaſt wee faint in the way.

Then ſaid his fellow trauayler loehere is water, heere is à meadow, here is à pleaſant place for vs to refresh and reſt vs à while, that we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endangering our health make an end of our iourney. Soe at the third motion (theſe words pleaſing his eare, and the place his eye) he was ouer come, conſented and eate. At the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he came to the Monaſtery, where conducted to the venerable Father he craued his benediction and prayers. But preſently the holy man reprooued him for what he had done in the way ſaying, what was it Brother that the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant enemye ſuggeſted to thee in

                        <p>TO both theſe difficulties, I briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered before when I ſaid, that holy men (ſo far as they are one with God) are not ignorant of the mind of our Lord: for all that deuoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeke God, in their deuotion, and contemplation, are with God, but in regard they are depreſſed with the waight of this corruptible body, they are not wholy with God, and therefore for as much as they are vnited with God they know his ſecret iudgements, of which likewiſe they are ignorant, for as much as in reſpect ſeparated from him: And ſo they profeſſe his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments incomprehenſible which they cannot as yet thoroughly vnderſtand. But they who in ſpirit adheere vnto him, in this adhaeſion to God know his iudgements either by the ſacred words of ſcripture, or by hyden reuelations, ſo far as they are capable; theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they know and declare, but they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:173414:32"/> are ignorant of thoſe which God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealeth. Where vpon the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid when he had ſaid <hi>in my lippes I will pronunce all thy iudgments,</hi> immediately addeth <hi>of thy mouth,</hi> as if he had ſaid plainely. Thoſe iudgments I could both know, and pronounce which thou didſt tell me, for thoſe which thou ſpeakeſt not, thou concealeth from our knowledge. Thus the ſaying of the Prophet agrieth with that of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for the iudgments of God are both incomprehenſible, &amp; alſo thoſe which proceed from his mouth are vttered with the lippes of men, for being ſo manifeſted they may be both concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and expreſſed by men, nor can they be concealed.</p>

And the holy man à litle after demanded whether he had done what he willed him, the Monke anſwered that he had not giuen it, ſaying that if he should
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173414:45"/> haue giuen that, there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left for the Religious; hereat the good Father much diſpleaſed, bad ſome other take the glaſſe bottle in which there remained a little oyle &amp; caſt it out of the window, that nothing of the fruits of diſobedience might be left to peſter the Monaſtery; which was accordingly done: vnder the window was à ſteepe fall full of huge rough ſtones, vpon which the glaſſe fell, yet it remained as whole, and entyre as if it had not bin throwne downe, ſo that neither the glaſſe was broke, nor the oyle ſpilt; which the man of God commanded to be taken vp and giuen to him that asked it. Then calling the Monkes together he rebuked the Religious man before them all for his pride, &amp; want of confidence.</p>

                     <p>HAuing ended the chapter he and all the Monkes fell to their prayers. In the place they prayed was an empty tunne cloſſe couered. As the holy man continued his prayer the couer of the ſaid tunne beganne to be heaued vp by the oyle encreaſing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, which runne ouer the brim of the veſſel vpon the floore in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance.

Then he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the diſtruſtfull, and diſobedient Monke to haue confidence in God, and learne humility. So the Brother thus reprehended was much ashamed, becauſe the venerable Father did not onely by word admonish him; but alſo did miraculouſly show the power of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:173414:46"/> Allmighty God. Nor could any man afterwardes doubt of what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſith as it were in à moment: for à glaſſe bottle almoſt empty he had reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored à tunne full of oyle.</p>

And that both wayes they worke miracles is manifeſt in St. Peter, who by prayer rayſed Tabitha from death; and punished with death Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias and Saphira for their falshood.

                     <p>A Certaine Goth named Galla, was of the impious ſect of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. This fellow in the time of their king Totila was moſt malitiouſly bent againſt all good, and deuout catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes; in ſo much that if any clargie man, or monke came in his ſight, he was ſure not to eſcape aliue from him: This man enraged with an inſatiable couetouſnes of ſpoile, and pillage, light one day vpon à huſbandman whom he tortured with ſeuerall torments; the man not able to endure the paine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted his goodes to the cuſtody of the ſeruant of God Benedict, this he faigned to the end he might free himſelfe from torments, and prolong his life for ſome time. Then this Galla gaue ouer tormenting him, and tying his armes together with à

Thus the poore man runne before him with his handes bounde, &amp; brought him to the holy mans Monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, whom he found ſitting alone at the Monaſtery gate, and reading. Then the countryman ſaid to Galla who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed furiouſly after him: loe this is the holy man Benedict, whom I told you of. The barbarous ruffian looking vpon him with enraged fury, thought to afright him with his vſuall threats, an with hydeous noiſe cried out vnto him riſe, riſe, and deliuer vp this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes goodes which thou haſt taken into thy cuſtody. At theſe clamorous wordes the man of God ſuddainely lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp his eyes from reading, and ſaw him with the huſbandman whom he kept bound, but as he caſt his eye vpon his armes, in à wonderfull manner the cordes beganne to fall of ſo quickly, that no man could poſſibly haue ſo ſoone vntyed them.

                        <p>VVHo was euer (Peter,) in this life more ſublime in perfection, &amp; ſanctitie chan. St. Paule, who not with ſtanding three times craued of our Lord to be free from the motions of the flesh, yet could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it? To this purpoſe I muſt tell you à paſſage concerning the venerable Father Benedict, that there was ſome thing he deſired, and was not able to accomplish. His ſiſter Scholaſtica who was conſecrated to God from her very childehood, vſed to come once à yeare to ſee him; vnto whom the man of God was wont to goe to à houſe not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gate with in the poſſeſſion of the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:173414:51"/> Monaſtery. Thither she came one day according to her cuſtome, and her venerable brother like wiſe with his diſciples, where after they had ſpent the whole day in the prayſe of God, and pious diſcourſes, the night draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, they tooke their refection together. As they were yet ſetting at table, and protracting the time with holy conference, the vertuous, and Religious virgin his ſiſter began to importune him ſaying: I beſeech you (good Brother) leaue me not this night, that we may entertaine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vntill next morning in diſcourſes of the ioyes of heauen. To whom he anſwered. What is this you ſay, ſiſter? by no meanes can I ſtay out of my Monaſtery. At this time the sky was very cleare, and not à cloud was to be ſeene in the ayre. The holy Nunne therefore hearing her Brothers deniall, layed her hands vpon the table faſt clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together, and vpon them inclined her head to make her prayer to All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: As she rayſed vp her
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:173414:51"/> head againe from the table, on à ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain beganne ſuch vehement light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and thunder, with ſuch aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of raine that neither venerable Benedict, nor his Brethren were able to put foote out of doores. For the holy virgin when she leaned her head on her hands, powred forth à flood of teares vpon the table, by which she changed the faire weather into foule, and rainy. For immediately followed that inundation of waters, and ſuch was the coherence with her prayers, and the ſtorme; that as she lifted vp her head, the cracke of thunder was heard; as if the rayſing vp of her head, and the bringing downe theſe floodes of raine had concurred in one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. The holy man perceiuing that by reaſon of thunder, and lightning with continuall showres of raine, he could not poſſibly retourne, was in great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of mind, and ſaid vnto her: God Allmighty forgiue you (ſiſter) what is this you haue done? she repleyed, I made my requeſt to you, &amp; you would
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:173414:52"/> not heare me; I prayed to Allmighty God, and you ſee he hath granted it. Now therefore if you can goe forth to the Monaſtery, and leaue me. But he not able to retourne was forced to ſtay againſt his will. Thus it ſo fell out that they ſpent the night in watching, and receiued full content in ſpirituall diſcourſe of heauenly matters. By this it appeares (as I ſaid before) that the holy man deſired ſome thing which he could not obtaine. For if we conſider the intent of the venerable Father, without quaeſtion he would haue had the faire weather to continue in which he came forth. But it pleaſed Allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, by meanes of à woman mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly to cauſe the contrary. And noe wonder if at that time, à woman were more powerfull then he, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring she had à long deſire to ſee him; and therefore ſith as St. Iohn affirmeth <hi>God is charity</hi> with good reaſon she was more powerfull who loued more.</p>

And now the time of reſt being come, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Benedict went vp to the hygher roome of the tower, and Seruandus had his lodging in the lower, from which there was an open paſſage to aſcend to the hygher, and ouer againſt the ſaid tower was à large building in which the diſciples of both repoſed while as yet the Monkes were at reſt, the ſeruant of God Benedict riſeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the night office, ſtood at the window, and made his prayer to All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God about midnight, when ſuddainely he looked forth, and ſaw à light glancing from aboue ſo bright, &amp; reſplendent, that it not onely diſperſed the darkenes of the night, but shined more cleare then the day it ſelfe. This was à merueilous ſtrange viſion, for (as he afterwardes related) the whole world compacted as it were together, was repreſented to his eyes in one ray or ſunne beame.

The ſoule thus raptin the light of God, is in her interiour lifted vp, and enabled

Six dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure, he cauſed his graue to be opened; and immediately after he fell into à feuour, by the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce where of his ſtrength began to decay, and

The very ſame day two of his Diſciples, the one liueing in the Monaſtery, the other in à place far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, had à reuelation in one, and the ſelfe ſame manner.

                  <p>Firſt of all that what good thinge ſoeuer thou beginſt to doe, thou begge of him with moſt earneſt praier to perfect it: that he who hath now vouchſafed to reckon vs in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his children may not herafter be contriſtated by our ill deeds: for wee muſt ſoe at all times ſerue him with the goods he hath beſtowed vpon vs, that neither as an angry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may not herafter diſinherit his children; nor as a dreadfull Lord exaſperated by our offences deliuer vs ouer as wicked ſeruants to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall punishment, who would not follow him to glory.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therfore at length ariſe the ſcripture exciting vs, and ſaying; It is now the houre to riſe from ſleepe. And our eyes being opened to the deifying light, let vs with aſtonished eares heare what the diuine voice daily crye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, admonisheth vs ſayeing. This day if you shall heare his voyce, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

                  <p>And our Lord ſeeking his labourer amongſt the multitude to whom here he ſpeaketh, ſayeth againe, Who is the man that will haue life, and deſireth to ſee good dayes? which if thou hearing anſwereſt; I.

And when you haue done this; my eyes shall be vpon you; and my eares shall be open to your prayers, and before you can call vpon me, I will ſay, Behold I am preſent. What thing deare brethren can be more ſweet vnto vs, then this voyce of our Lord inuiting vs? Behold our Lord
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173414:64"/> through his piety sheweth vnto vs the waye of life.</p>
                  <p>Our loynes therefore being girt with faith and the obſeruance of good workes, and our feet shodde by guida<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Ghoſpell of peace let vs walke in his wayes, that wee may deſerue to ſee him who hath called vs vnto his kingdome. In the tabernacle of whoſe Kingdome if wee deſire to dwell, wee muſt apply our ſelues to good workes which is the only meanes wherby it is to bee attained. But let vs aske our Lord with the Prophet ſayeing vnto him; Lord who shall dwell in thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, or who shall reſt in thy holy hill? After this queſtion brethren let vs heare our Lord anſwering; and shewing vs the waye that leades to his tabernacle, ſaying. He that walketh without ſpott, and worketh iuſtice. He that ſpeaketh truth in his hart, that hath not forged guile in his tongue. He that hath not done euill to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and hath not receiued reproch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his neighbour. He that reiecting out of his minde the malignant Deuill,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173414:64"/> with all his ſuggeſtions hath brought them all to nought, and hath taken his beginning thoughts and dasht them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>They who feare our Lord doe not take pride in their good obſeruance and well doing, but knowing that all the good they haue, or can doe, proceedes not from themſelues, but is done by our Lord, magnifie our Lord thus workinge in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſayinge with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; Not to vs Lord not to vs, but to thy name giue glory. So Paule the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did not impute any thinge of his preaching to himſelfe ſaying by the grace of God I'am what I am. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganie he ſaith. He that gloryeth let him glory in our Lord; And here vpon alſo our Lord ſaith in the Ghoſpell. He that heareth theſe my words, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them, I will liken him to a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that hath built his houſe vpon a roche. The floods came, the winds blew, and beate againſt that houſe, and it fell not; becauſe it was founded vpon a rocke. Our Lord fulfilling theſe things, expecteth dayly that wee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173414:65"/> should by deeds anſwer to theſe his holy admonitions.</p>
                  <p>Therefore for the amendment of our euills, he prolonges the dayes of this our life according to the words of the Apoſtle ſaying, Knoweſt thou not that the patience of God bringeth thee to repentance? For our pious Lord ſaith, I will not the death of a ſinner but rather that he be conuerted and liue. Hauing therfore my brethren demanded of our Lord, who should be the Inhabitour of his Tabernacle, we haue hard what his duty and charge is; which if we fulfill, we shall be Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of his heauenly Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Now Therefore let vs prepare our harts and bodyes to fight vnder the holy obedience of his commandes, and what nature in vs is not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, let vs begge of our Lord to ſupply it with the aſſiſtance of his grace. And if wee deſire to avoyde the paines of Hell, and to attaine to euerlaſting life; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt yet time ſerues, and whileſt wee liue in this mortall flesh, and that wee may performe all theſe things by the light of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173414:65"/> Grace, let vs haſten and doe that now, which may be expedient for vs for euer hereafter. Wee are therefore now to inſtitute a ſchoole of the ſeruice of God. In which ſchoole or inſtitution wee hope nothing shall be ordained too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gourous or burden ſome. But if in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinges we proceede with a litle ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, reaſon ſo requiring, for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vices or preſeruing of charity, do not ſtraightwayes for feare there of fly from the way of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtraight and difficult in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But in proceſſe and continuance of this holy courſe and conuerſation, the hart being once dilated, the way of Gods commandements is runne with vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpeakable ſweetnes of loue: ſo as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer departing from his ſchoole, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuering in the monaſtery in his doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vntill death, by patience wee parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipat of the ſufferings of Chriſt, that wee may deſerue afterwards to bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his kingdome.

                     <p>IT is well knowne that there are foure kindes of Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes. The firſt is of Coenobites, that is monaſteriall or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentuall liuing vnder a Rule or Abbot. The ſecond kinde is of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorits, that is, Hermits, who not by à Nouitiall feruour of deuotion but by long probation in a monaſticall kinde of life haue learnt by the comfort and encouragement of others to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Deuill, and being well armed, ſecure now without the help of any are able by Gods aſſiſtance to fight hand to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againſt the vices of the flesh and euill cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; and ſoe proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fraternall army to the ſingle combat of of the wildernes. The third and worſt kinde of Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks are the Sarabaits who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not beene tryed vnder any Rule, by the experience of a skilfull maiſter, as gold vſeth to be tryed in the furnace; but ſoftned according to the nature of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173414:66"/> lead, by their workes adhering yet to the world, are knowne by their tonſure to be diſloyall to God: who two or three or perhaps ſingle without a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard are shut vp, not in our Lords sheepfolds but in theire owne: and the pleaſure of their deſiers is to them a lawe, and whatſoeuer they like or make choiſe of, this they will haue to be holy, and what they miſlike, that not to be lawfull. The fourth kinde of mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks be thoſe which are called Girouagi or wanderers, who all their life time wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der through diuers prouinces, and gueſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>wiſe ſtay two or three days in one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, and then in another, and are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wandering and neuer ſetled, and giuing themſelues alltogether to their owne pleaſures, and to the inticements of gluttony, are generally in all things worſe then the Sarabaits. Of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conuerſation of all which, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be ſilent then to ſay much.

                     <p>AN Abbot who is worthy to haue charge of a monaſtery, ought all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to remember what he is called, and to expreſſe in his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the name of Antient. For in the monaſtery he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the perſon of Chriſt, ſeing he is called by his name or title, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith. Ye haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption of children in which wee cry abba father: And therfore the Abbot ought to teach ordaine or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is conformable to the commandes of our Lord (and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid he should do otherwiſe) But let his commands and doctrine be mingled in the minds of his diſciples, with the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the diuine iuſtice. Let the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot allways be mindefull that in the dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dfull iudgement of God he is to giue account both of his doctrine, and of the obedience of his diſciples. And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173414:67"/> let him know that it will be found the sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pheards fault, what want of profit ſoeuer the maiſter of the family shall find in his sheep: But if he haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed all diligence on his vnquiet and diſobedient flocke, and haue employed the vttermoſt of his care for curing of their corrupt manners, then shall he be diſcharged in the iudgement of our Lord, and may ſay with the Prophet, I haue not hidden thy iuſtice in my hart, I haue told thy truth and thy ſaluation: but they contemning deſpiſed me. And then finally death as a iuſt punishment shall be inflicted vpon the diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sheepe.</p>
                     <p>When therfore any one taketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the name of an Abbot, he ought to gouerne his diſciples with a twofold doctrine, that is, To shew them all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſanctity more by deeds then by words: and to capable diſciples he may declare the commandements of God by words, but to the hard harted perſons and to ſuch as are more ſimple, he muſt shew them by his actions and life. And all things which he shall teach his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173414:68"/> diſciples to be vnfitting, by his owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions let him shew that they ought not to be done: leaſt preaching well to others, hee himſelfe be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reprobate, and God ſay vnto him ſinning. Why doeſt thou declare my iuſtices, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt my teſtament in thy mouth, Thou haſt hated diſcipline and haſt caſt my ſpeeches behind thee. And, Thou who haſt ſeene a moate in thy brothers eye, haſt not ſeene a beame in thy owne. Let there be no acception of perſons in the monaſtery. Let not one be loued or fauoured more then an other, except ſuch a one as in good workes and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience shall be found to ſurpaſſe others. Let not a free ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or of better parentage coming to Religion, be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him who is of ſeruile or meaner condition, except there be ſome other reaſonable cauſe for it. But if vpon iuſt conſiderations the Abbot shal ſoe think fitting let him doe it, in any rancke or degree what ſoeuer, otherwiſe let euery one keepe their owne places. Becauſe whether bondman or free man, wee are all one in Chriſt, and beare an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173414:68"/> burthen of ſeruitude vnder one Lord; for with God there is noe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of perſons. Onely in this he maketh a difference, if in good workes and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility wee ſurpaſſe others.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let the Abbot beare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall loue to wards all: and let all be ſubiect to the ſame orders, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline according to their deſerts. For the Abbot ought all wayes in his doctrine to obſerue that Apoſtolicall forme where it is ſayd, Reprooue, intreate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that is; tempering, as times and occaſions require, faire ſpeeches with terrours. Let him shew both the ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a maiſter, and the pious affection of a father: that is, he ought sharply to reproue ſuch as are diſordered and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and of the other ſide to deale by intreaty with tuch as ar obedient mild and patient, exhorting them to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in vertue. But by all meanes the negligent and contumacious perſons let him ſeuerely reprooue and chaſtiſe.</p>
                     <p>Let him not diſſemble the ſinnes of delinque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but as ſoone as they appeare, let him vſe all poſſible endeuour vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173414:69"/> to roote them out, remembring the danger of Hely Prieſt of Silo. The more honeſt and vnderſtanding diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions let him for the firſt and ſecond time admonish by words; but the ſtubborne, hard harted, proud and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, euen in the very beginning of ſinne, let him chaſtiſe with ſtripes, and bodily punishment, knowing that it is written. The foole is not corrected with words. And againe; Strike thy ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne with the rod, and thou shalt deliuer his ſoule from death.</p>
                     <p>The Abbot ought always to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what he is, and what he is called, and that to whom more is committed, from him more is exacted. And let him conſider what a difficult and hard taske he hath vndertaken, to gouerne ſoules, and to accommodate himſelf to the humors of many. Whereof ſome ar to be led by faire ſpeeches, others by sharp reprehenſions, and others by sharp reprehenſions, and others by perſwaſions. Therefore let him ſoe conforme himſelf to each one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their quality and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that he may not onely ſuffer noe loſſe in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173414:69"/> the flock committed to him, but may alſo reioyce in the increaſe and profit of his vertuous flocke.</p>
                     <p>Aboue all things let him take heede leaſt he diſſemble or litle regard the ſaluation of the ſoules committed to him, and haue more care of tranſitory and worldly things: but let him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conſider that he hath vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gouernment of ſoules, of which he is alſo to giue an account. And that he may not complayne for want of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall meanes let him remember what is written. Seeke firſt the kingdome of God and his iuſtice, and all theſe thinges shall be giuen v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>to you. And againe, Nothing is wanting to ſuch as feare him. And let him know that he who vndertakes the gouernment of ſoules muſt prepare himſelfe to giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. And what the number of brethren vnder his care is, let him certainly know that at the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he is to giue an account to our Lord of all their ſoules beſides the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he is to giue for his owne. And ſo alwayes fearing the future account of

                     <p>THe holy ſcripture cryeth to vs brethren ſaying, Euery one who exalteth himſelfe shall be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, and he who humbleth himſelfe, shall be exalted. Hereby declaring vnto vs, that all exaltation, is a kinde of pride, which the Prophet sheweth how carefully he auoyded, ſaying; Lord my hart is not exalted neither are my eyes lifted vp; neither haue I walked in great things, nor in wonders aboue my ſelfe. But what? If I did not thinke humbly but haue exalted my ſoule: As a child weaned from his mother, ſoe wilt thou reward my ſoule. Wherfore brethren, if we will attaine to true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and will ſpeedily come to that heauenly exaltation to which we aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the humility of this preſent life; by our aſcending actions that ladder is to be ſet vp which appeared to Iacob
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:173414:75"/> in his ſleepe, where he ſaw Angels deſcending and aſcending. That deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and aſcent ſignifieth nothing elſe, but that wee deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by exalting our ſelues. and aſcend by humbling our ſelues. And this ladder thus erected is our life here in this world, which by humility of hart is lifted vp to heauen by our Lord; And the ſydes of this ladder we vnderſtande to be our body and ſoule, in which the diuine maieſty hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced diuers degrees of humility, &amp; diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to be aſcended.</p>

                     <p>THe firſt degree of humility is to haue always the feare of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, and not to forgett himſelfe But to be ſtill mindefull of all thinges that God hath commanded: &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ſuch as contemne God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uerlaſting life is prepared for ſuch as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:173414:76"/> feate him. And ſoe to keepe himſelfe from all ſinne &amp; vice of thought, word eyes, hands, feet and proper will; and ſoe ſpeedely cut of all fleshly deſiers. Let him thinke himſelfe to be always beheld from heauen of God; and all his actions, whereſoeuer he be, to ly open to his diuine ſight, and to be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God euery howre by his Angells. The Prophet declareth this when he saith God to be allways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our thoughts in theſe words, God ſearcheth the hart and reynes And, Our Lord knoweth the thoughts of men that they are vaine. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, Thou haſt vnderſtoode my thoughts a fare of. &amp; The thought of man shall confeſſe to thee. Let therfore the humble brother, that he may be carefull to auoid euill thoughts, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſaie in his hart. Then shall I be with out ſpott before him, if I shall keepe me from my iniquity. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſoe forbiddeth vs to doe our owne will ſaying, Leaue thy owne will &amp; deſire. And beſides we begge of God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:173414:76"/> in our daily praier that his will may be done in vs.</p>
                     <p>We are taught therefore with good reaſon to take heede of doing our owne will, the ſcripture ſaying. There are wayes which ſeeme right to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the end where of plungeth eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the deepe pitt of hell. And againe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of negligent perſous; They are corrupted and made abominable in their pleaſures. And in the deſiers of the flesh wee ought to beleeue God to be alwayes preſent to vs, according to that of the Prophet ſpeaking to our Lord Before thee is all my deſire. Let vs then take heed of ill deſires, becauſe death is neare to the entrance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, where vpon the ſcripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth. Follow not thy concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences. If therefore the eyes of our Lord behold both good &amp; bad, and our Lord always lookes downe from heauen vpon the ſonnes of men, to ſee who is vnder ſtanding or ſeekeing God; and that our workes are by our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells Guardians daye &amp; night told to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:173414:77"/> our Lord and maker; We muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take heed, Brethren, leaſt (as the Prophet in the Pſalme ſaieth) God ſometymes behold vs declining to euill &amp; become vnprofitable: and though he ſpare vs for the preſent becauſe he is mercifull and expecteth our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and amendment, leaſt he ſay to vs hereafter, Theſe thinges thou haſt done &amp; I haue held my peace.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond degree of humility is, If not louing his owne will he ſeeke not to ſatisfie his deſiers, but imitate that ſaying of our Lord, I came not to doe my owne will, but the will of him who ſent me. The ſcripture likwiſe ſaieth; The will hath punishment, and neceſſity purchaſeth à crowne.</p>
                     <p>The third degree of humility is, If for the loue of God he ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with all obedience to his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, imitating our Lord of whom the Apoſtell ſayth, He was made obedient euen to death.</p>
                     <p>The fourth degree of humility is, If that in obedience hard and contrary
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:173414:77"/> things &amp; alſo iniurious beinge done to him, he imbrace them patiently with a quiet conſcience; and ſuffering growe not wearye, and giue ouer, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the ſcripture, Who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuereth vntill the end he shall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And againe, let thy hart be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted &amp; expect our Lord. And she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that the faithfull man ought for our Lord to beare all thinges, though neuer ſo contrary, he ſayth in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſufferers. For thee we ſuffer death all the daye longe: wee are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as sheep of the ſlaughter. And being aſſured by hope, of à reward at Gods handes they goe on reioycing &amp; ſaying, But in all theſe thinges, we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the help of him who hath loued vs. And likewiſe in another pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the ſcripture ſaith. Thou haſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oued vs o Lord: thou haſt tried vs with fire as ſiluer is tried. Thou haſt brought vs into the ſnare; Thou haſt laid tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation vpon our backs. And to shew that we ought to be vnder a Prior or ſuperiour he followes on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173414:78"/> ſaying. Thou haſt placed men ouer our heads, Fulfilling alſo by patience the precept of our Lord in aduerſityes &amp; iniuries, being ſtruck on the one cheeke they offer the other: leaue their cloakes to him who takes awaye their coate; &amp; being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayned to carry a burden one mile, goe two miles. And with Paule the Apoſtle ſuffer falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren &amp; perſecutions, and bleſſe thoſe who reuile and ſpeake ill of them.</p>
                     <p>The fift degree of humility is, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to his Abbot by humble confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion all the ill thoughts of his hart, and ſecret faults committed by him. The ſcripture exhorteth vs hereunto ſaying. Reueale thy waye to our Lord, and hope in him. And againe, Confeſſe to our Lord becauſe he is good, becauſe his mercy is for euer. And furthermore the Prophet ſaith, I haue made knowne vnto thee mine offence, &amp; I haue not hidden my iniuſtices. I haue ſaid, I will declare openly againſt my ſelfe to our Lord mine iuiuſtices: and thou haſt pardoned the wickednes of my hart.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:173414:78"/>
                     <p> The ſixt degree of humility is. If a monke be content with all baſenes and extremity, &amp; in all thinges which are inioyned him, he thinke himſelfe an euill and vnworthy ſeruant, ſaying with the Prophet. I haue beene brought to nothing, &amp; knew not. I haue beene made like a beaſt with thee, and I always with thee.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth degree of humility is, that he not onely pronounce with his tongue, but alſo with his very hart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue himſelfe to be inferiour to all &amp; moſt abiect; and humbling himſelfe ſaye with the Prophet. I am a worme and not a man, the reproch of men &amp; the outcaſt of the People. I am exalted, humbled and confounded. And againe, It is good for me that thou haſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, that I may learne thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
                     <p>The eight degree of humility is. That a monke doe nothing but what the common Rule of the monaſtery or the examples of his ſeniors teach and exhort him.</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:173414:79"/>
                     <p> The ninght degree of humility is, For a monke to refraine his tongue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaking and be ſilent till a queſtion be asked him, remembring the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſcripture. In many words ſinne shall not be auoided; &amp; that a talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man shall not be directed vpon earth.</p>
                     <p>The tenth degree of humility is, Not to be facile and prompt to laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for it is written, The foole exalteth his voice in laughter.</p>
                     <p>The eleuenth degree of humility is, For a monke when he ſpeaketh, to ſpeake gently and with out laughter, humbly, with grauity or fewe words, and diſcreetly, and not be clamorous in his voice; for it is written, A wiſe man is knowne by ſpeaking few words.</p>
                     <p>The twelfth degree of humility is For a monke not only to haue humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his hart, but alſo to shew it in his exteriour to all that behold him; at worke, in the Monaſtery, in the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, in the Garden, in the fielde, in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:173414:79"/> the waye or where ſoeuer, ſitting, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or ſtanding, that he haue alwayes has head inclined &amp; his eyes fixed on the grownde, thinking himſelfe euer guilty for his; ſinnes, and ready to be preſented before the dreadfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, and ſo ſaying to himſelfe with the Publican of the Ghoſpell; Lord, I a ſinner am not worthy to life mine eyes vp to heauen. And againe with the Prophet; I am bowed downe and humbled on euery ſide. And thus all theſe degrees of humility being aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, a monke shall preſently come to that loue of God which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and expelleth feare, whereby all things which at the beginni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued through feare, he shall now begin to doe by cuſtome without any labour as it were naturally, not for the feare of Hell, but for the loue of Chriſt, and out of à good cuſtome and a delight in vertue, which our Lord will by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt voutchſafe to worke in his ſeruant now cleare from vice &amp; ſinne.</p>

                     <p>IDlenes is an enemy of the ſoule, and therefore at certaine howers the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:173414:105"/> brethren ought to be imployed in han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye labour, and other whiles in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reading. And therefore we thinke that both times maye thus be well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: that is, from Eaſter vntill the kalends of october, in the morning going out from Prime, they doe that which shall be neceſſary vntill well nigh the fourth hower. And from the fourth hower till well nigh the ſixt hower, let them be imployed in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; after the ſixt hower riſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> table, let them reſt on their Beds with all ſilence, and he who then perhaps deſires to reade, let him reade ſoe to him ſelfe, that he diſquiet not other. Let None be ſaid ſome that ſooner, about the eight houre, and after that let them doe what they haue to doe vntill euening. And if the neceſſity of the place, or pouerty require that they themſelues be imployed in reaping their corne, let them not be contriſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Becauſe they are then truly Monkes when they liue by the labour of their hands, as both our fathers and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173414:106"/> the Apoſtles did. Yet let all thinges be done in meaſure by reaſon of ſuch as are puſillanimous.</p>
                     <p>And from the kalends of october vntill the beginning of Lent, let them be imployed in reading till full the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hower, and at the ſecond hower, let Terce be celebrated, then vntill the ninth hower, let all labour in the worke which is enioyned them. But the firſt ſigne of the ninth hower being giuen, let them all departe from theire worke, and let them be ready when the ſecond ſigne shall be made. And after refection let them be imployed in reading of ſpirituall bookes or Pſalmes.</p>
                     <p>But in Lent let them be imployed in readinge from the morninge till the third howre compleat: and vntill the tenth hower compleat let them doe the worke enioyned them. In whih time of Lent, let each one take à booke out of the Librarie, reade it all ouer in order; and let theſe bookes be giuen them in the begining of Lent. Let
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:173414:106"/> there be diligent care taken, that there be one or two ſeniors appointed, who maye goe vp and downe the Monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery at the howers in which the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ar imployed in reading, to ſee leaſt any of them be ſlouth full, or applie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to idlenes or foulish talke, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecte his reading, and ſoe not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to himſelfe, but alſo an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to others. If ſuch a one (which god forbid) be founde, let him be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended once or twice, and if he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend not, let him be liable to regular diſcipline, ſoe that others maye take warning by it. Neither let one brother aſſociat himſelf whith an other at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent howers. On ſondaye let all be imployed in reading, except ſuch as are deputed for officers. And if any one shall be ſo ſlouthfull or negligent, that he will not or cannot meditate or read, let him haue ſome worke inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to keepe him from idlenes. To the weake brethren, &amp; tender of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, let ſuch worke or art be inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as they maye be kept from idlenes,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:173414:107"/> and yet not oppreſſed with ſoe much labour ſo as to be driuen awaye, whoſe weaknes therefore ought to be well conſidered by the Abbot.</p>

Let there be ſuggeſted to him the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor &amp; auſterity by which we tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. And if he promiſe ſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, after two moneths ſpace let this rule be read to him in order, and let there beſaid to him.

If he shall ſtill perſeuer, then let him be brought in to the afore ſayd cell of the nouices, and let him be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine tryed in all patience. And after the ſpace of ſix moneths, let the Rule be read againe to him that he may know to what he enters in. And if he ſtill perſeuer, after foure moneths let the Rule be read againe to him. And if vppon deliberation had with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he shall promiſe that he will keepe and obſerue all things commanded him, then let him be receaued in to the

                     <p>And when they admitt him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion let him in the oratorie before, all, make a promiſe of his ſtability, and conuerſion of his manners, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience before God &amp; his ſaints, that if at any time he shall doe otherwiſe, he may know that he shall be condemned by him whom he mocketh. Of which promiſe let him make a petition in the name of thoſe ſaints whoſe reliques are there, &amp; of the Abbot there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which petition let him writte whith his owne hand, or if he can not writte, let an other requeſted by him writte it; and the nouice himſelf put to his ſigne, and let him lay it on the alter with his owne hand; which when he hath done let him preſently beginne this verſe. <hi>Suſcipe me Domine ſecundum</hi>

Let him therefore preſently in the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie be ſtript of his owne garments where with he is cloathed, and let him be cloathed with the garments of the Monaſtery.

Let Monkes therefore exerciſe this zeale with moſt feruent loue, that is, that they preuent each other with honour, that they paciently ſuffer each others infirmityes, whether they be of body or of minde, and that they ſtriue to obey each other. Let none follow that which he thinks profitable for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but rather what others thinke fitting. Let them shew all brotherly charity with a chaſt loue. Let them feare God, and loue their Abbot with a ſincere and humble affection, and prefer nothing at all before Chriſt, who
